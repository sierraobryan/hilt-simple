# hilt-simple
Simple app to demonstrate using [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for Dependency injection with Mockk for testing framework. Shares basic functionality and architecture with the [koin-simple repo](https://github.com/sierraobryan/koin-simple) to compare and contrast usage with that of [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) as major DI options in native Android with Kotlin.
